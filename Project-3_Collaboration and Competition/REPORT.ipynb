        "In this collaboration and competition project, we deploy the **DDPG** algorithm along with the **MADDPG** algorithm, which is a **Multi-Agent DDPG** as DDPG wrapper. When it comes to DDPG, it can simultaneously learn a Q-function and it's policy. Next, it uses off-policy data and the Bellman equation to learn the Q-function. Fianlly, DDP learns the policy by using the Q-function. This paired mechanism is called a actor-critic method.  \n",

MADDPG method comes in handy to get better result, compared to the original DDPG, in that, the original DDPG repeat a simple extension of single agent RL by independently training the two agents. It hardly works very well since the agents are individually updating their policiess when learning the prediction . Furthermore, this causes the environment to look like a non-stationary process from the viewpoint among one of the agent. \n",
